# Aurelia-Bootstrap-Plugins

### Introduction
`Aurelia-Bootstrap-Plugins` was coded to bridge with a set of commonly used 3rd party Bootstrap addons. The goal of these Plugins is to support, as much as possible, the full suite of (`options`, `methods` & `events`) from their original 3rd party addons while easily using them in Aurelia.
